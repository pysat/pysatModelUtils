"""
Supports exported model data from pysatDINEOF, a Python package
that interfaces with a version of Data Interpolation Empirical
Orthogonal Functions (DINEOFs). This module couples into
the systematic export pysatDINEOF format and thus should support
all exports from the package.

Given the generality of the support, each model series is identified
using the `tag` keyword.

DINEOFs are a purely data based method that can analyze a data-set, with
data gaps, and extract a series of basis functions that optimally reproduce
the input data. The quality of the reconstruction is primarily determined
by the quantity and quality of the input data.

    ['']
tag : string

Note
----
::

    Specific tags are not listed here as this method is intended to support
    all pysatDINEOF export models. Place the desired model (daily files)
    at '{pysat_data_dir}/pysat/dineof/{tag}'. It is presumed the default
    naming scheme of 'dineof_model_{year:04d}-{month:02d}-{day:02d}.nc'
    has been retained. Use the file_format option for custom filenames.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fnames : array-like
        iterable of filename strings, full path, to data files to be loaded.
        This input is nominally provided by pysat itself.
    tag : string ('')
        tag name used to identify particular data set to be loaded.

    -------
    data, metadata
        Data and Metadata are formatted for pysat. Data is an xarray

    data_path : string (None)

        is provided by pysat. The user may specify their own data path
        at Instrument instantiation and it will appear here.
    format_str : string (None)

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Series of filename strings, including the path, indexed by datetime.

    Examples
    --------
    ::

    multiple versions of a file the most recent version should be kept and the
    rest discarded. This routine uses the pysat.Files.from_os constructor, thus
    the returned files are up to pysat specifications.
